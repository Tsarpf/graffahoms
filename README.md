warning: this is really unstable since I haven't had the time yet to make it more than a proof of concept.
It:
- crashes if no audio is playing when you launch it
- crashes randomly
- needs you to have the correct audio settings on windows
- probably works rest of the time!

leave an issue if you want help to get it running

Built on top of my other project: https://github.com/Tsarpf/windows-default-playback-device-to-pcm-file

PCM samples from audio currently playing on Windows -> hanning function --> FFT library -> Logarithmization

--> live audio visualization of all playing audio
